# Transcriptomics-and-Gene-Ontology
## Transcriptomic Analysis Pipeline

#### Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for transcriptomic analysis, specifically differential expression analysis, performed on RNA-seq data from mutant and control samples. The focus of this study is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the transcription factor, forkhead protein (FKHR) mRNA, suspected to cause a genetic disease by altering gene expression.

#### Key Findings
The most significant SNP (C1103G) leads to a Proline-to-Arginine amino acid change in FKHR.

Differential expression analysis identified thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted:

Upregulation of mitotic processes, chromosome segregation, and mRNA processing.

Downregulation of ion homeostasis and autophagy pathways.
